Event booking plug-in for molsø.dk. It is custom built as a learning experience, and because no othe rplug.in seemed to 
provide the sought out-of-the-box experience. 

# Description #

In any article where the booking form should be available, use the following shortcode:

`[molsoe-event view=registration eventid=HR001]`

This will render the contact form right in the place where the shortcode is placed.
